## **QoE Prediction**

Through the massive collection of KPI that quantify the performance of a mobile access network, a practical approach has been developed for the **prediction of the Quality of Experience (QoE)** based on measurements performed by common smartphones and on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

To collect a large number of KPI, third-party web and mobile application have been used with the aim to make several test phone call and store the RAN principal KPIs.

In particular, the performance of different QoE prediction models has been compared in terms of two main parameters: the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and the Service Acceptability (SA).
The first parameter requires that the algorithms go in search of the solution of a "multi-class" classification problem, while the second concerns a binary classification problem.

## **KPIs**

*   Received Signal [dBm]
*   Speed [m/s]
*   Distance from site [m]
*   Call Test Duration [s]
*   Call Test Result
*   Technology (2G/3G/4G)
*   Call Test Setup [s]

## **Software and Libraries**
